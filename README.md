## Git Practices
The <code>master</code> branch and <code>develop</code> branch are restricted and thus cannot be pushed to directly. 
In order to merge into <code>master</code> or <code>develop</code>, a pull request must be submitted and approved by 3 developers.

The <code>develop</code> branch is the main working branch and when a developer begins coding a
feature, they must branch off of <code>develop</code> (making a new branch with the name of the feature inside
the branch name) and submit a pull request from the completed feature branch to be merged back into <code>develop</code> once they have completed the feature.
Once all features have been completed on <code>develop</code> for the final version, a final pull request will be submitted and all previous
work will be merged to <code>master</code>.
